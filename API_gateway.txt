Featuers/Advantages of API gateway:
1. Routing: Used as an absraction layer for URLs...
		i.e, frontend/client will call apigateway and apigateway will route request to appropriate services
		Any change in location/url of microservices, will not affect the client. Updating apigateway with modified url is ONLY required.
2. We can have different apigateway for different clients
		i.e, for web browser, mobile and 3rd party apps we can have separate webApiGateway. MobileGateway and publicApiGateway and send responses accordingly.
3. Protocal translation:
		i.e, convert https request to http/snmp/amqp/gRPC etc.
4. Security
5. Auditing : any request/reponse passing through api gateway can be logged.


Drawbacks of API gateway:
1. Complexity : by time apigateway complexity will increase. As we need to map token, mapping request/response of each client etc for individual microservice.
2. Latency: as request comes from apigateway and then directed to microservice, there will be some latency in response time.
3. One point failure: apigateway needs to Highly Available/Highly fault tolearnt all the time. If it is down then all clients are implacted as it is a single entry point to all microservice
