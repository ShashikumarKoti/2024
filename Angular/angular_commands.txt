commands:
node -v      : to check node version
npn -v       : to check npm version
npm install -g @angular/cli@12   : to install angular 12 version
ng version   : to check installed angular version
ng new <project_name> : to create new angular project_name
ng serve   : to start angular application. This has to be executed from inside the project.
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider  : if any Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported  error observed during <ng serve>
npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular   :  run this command for below error	
				 An unhandled exception occurred: Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/build-angular/package.json
				 
				 
ng generate component <component name>  : to create component	
ng g c <component name>  : shorform to create component
ng g m <module name>	 : shorform to create module.   Module can contain any number of components
ng g c <module name>/<component name> : to create component inside module
ng g class <folder name to create class>/<class name> : to create class inside a particular folder.
		This command geneartes 2 classes.
			1.<classname>.ts
			2.<classname>.spec.ts   - used for test cases
ng g interface 	<folder name to create interface>/<interface name>	 : 	to create interface inside a particular folder.
ng build  : used to build the application.. It will generate dist folder. This dist folder has to be placed in server and then run.

What is Component:
Components are building blocks of web page. To display different sections in a web page. like header component, profile component, main content component

Inline style and Inline template:
	If we use Inline style and Inline template, then app.commands.css and app.component.html will not used. The code which is supposed to be written in these 2 files shall we written
	in app.component.ts file
Inline style/template should be used when we have minimal changes in html and css and when most of the config are picked from main style.css
ng g c <component name> --inline-style   	: command to generate component with inline style ONLY
ng g c <component name> --inline-template   : command to generate component with inline template ONLY
ng g c <component name> --inline-template --inline-style  : command to generate component with BOTH inline style and inline template.


What is Module:
Module refers to a complete feature of an app. Ex: user-authentocation is a feature of any web app. So user-authentocation can be called one module.
Module can have multiple components, services(for api call) and pipes(helper classes) inside it...Ex: user-authentocation module can have login, signup, forgot password etc components
After creating a module, register the module in main app.module.ts file
Next, export the component created inside Module in the in the newly created module.ts file.

Note: A component created in a Module can be reused. But reusing entire Module will not make any sense, as it is a feature in itself.

Make and call a function:
Function should be created in app.component.ts file or our own <own_component>.component.ts file
Note: From Angular12 , we need to pass the datatype also of the params used in a function.Else it will be error.
In previous versions of angular, the strict value present in tsconfig.json was false hence no error if datatype is not defined. From Angular12 strict value is set to true by default.


Events:
call functions on mouse hover, blur, keyup, click of a button , click on a link, enter value in input box etc are all called events.
keyup event : event called when any key is pressed and also released.  Note: after releasing the key only the event is called.
keydown event : event called when any key is just pressed.
blur : event is called when we enter a value in input box and pointer/mouse is clicked somewhere out of the box . i.e focus is shifted to somewhere else.
mouseover : event called when we mouse over a particular thing
mouseleave : event called when after we mouse over a particular thing and move cursor away from it.
Note: we can add multiple events to a single element

Get TextBox value and print.
we can get text box value from placeholder, name attribute, from value and from Property Binding


 
File structure for begineers:
package.json  - contain dependencies/// Similar to pom.xml in java.... application will not run if this file is deleted
node_modules  - contain libraries... //Similar to external libraries in java
src folder:
	app  : contains component code which can be reused
	assets :  helps to keep images  //Similar to resources in java
	environments:  to main profiles for deploying in different environments like dev,release, staging, prod.//Similar to profiles in java
	index.html : this is the file which loads first in the project. 
	main.ts   : it bootstraps angular application on the html file. i.e to load the entire angular app into an html file.
	style.css   : used for global css
	
File structure for advance level:
	package-lock.json : it contain packages structure in details. i.e any if any dependencies are further dependent on any other dependencies, then those details 	are also maintained here.  application will still run if this file is deleted, as it will load all dependencies again from package.json
	angular.json : this is the configuration file for oyr application.
	tsconfig.json  :  all typeScript global configuration are maintained here.
	tsconfig.app.json : configuration specific to application are maintained here.
	tsconfig.spec.json : configuration required for testing are maintained here.
	.browserslistrc  : contains details of supported and unsupported browsers.
	karma.config.js  : mainly used for test cases.
	polyfills.ts:    libraries required for browsers are added here so that the content looks same in all browser types.
